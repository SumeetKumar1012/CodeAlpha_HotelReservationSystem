## 🏨Hotel Reservation System
🚀 Thrilled to share another key project from my internship — the Hotel Reservation System!
This project isn’t just about booking rooms — it’s a complete environment for guests and administrators, designed with OOP principles, a responsive Java Swing GUI, and
persistent storage to ensure reliability.

### ✨ Features

###  Secure Multi-User Access

* Guest Module – Register as a new user or log in as an existing guest.

* Admin Module – A separate, secure login for administrators with full hotel management tools.

###  Reliable Booking Logic

* Validated Date Picker – Prevents selecting past dates for check-in/out.

* Conflict Checking – Ensures rooms are never double-booked.

###  Dynamic Hotel Management

* Guests can search rooms by type (Standard, Deluxe, Suite).

* Admins can add/remove rooms, view all reservations, and cancel bookings by ID.

###  Data Persistence

* Stores users, rooms, and reservations in .dat files.

* Ensures data is retained even after restarting the application.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Language: Java (JDK 8+, tested on JDK 17)

* GUI: Java Swing (AWT, JFrame, JPanel)

* Library: JCalendar  (for date picking)

### 🎯 Future Enhancements

*  Integration with a database (MySQL/PostgreSQL)

*  Analytics & reporting dashboard for admins

*  Modernized UI with JavaFX
